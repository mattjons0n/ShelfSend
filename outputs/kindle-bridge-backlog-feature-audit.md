# ShelfSend backlog implementation audit

> **Scope:** This implementation record predates Kobo support. Shared library features now serve the selected e-reader; protocol details, action labels, and device evidence here retain their original Kindle scope. See the current [device guide](../docs/devices.md).

This document is the release-candidate omission audit for the backlog program in
[backlog build plan](kindle-bridge-backlog-build-plan.md). It separates software evidence from evidence that can only be collected with the household deployment, a provider credential, or the physical Kindle.

## Evidence rules

- **Implemented** means code and focused automated coverage exist in this repository.
- **Default off** means the bounded implementation exists, but production use remains disabled because the required physical acceptance has not been supplied.
- **External acceptance pending** is not an automated failure and must never be reported as physical proof.
- The final check result, commit, image result, and exact test count are recorded only after the candidate is frozen.

## Non-omission checks

- Mounted originals remain immutable; edits and covers live in `/data`, extracted covers in `/cache`, and conversion/PDOC work only on browser-local derivatives.
- Profiles remain organizational views, not authentication boundaries; no Calibre, cloud conversion/storage, NAS-vendor package, or application-managed SMB/NFS mount was introduced.
- WebUSB permission remains user initiated. No Send, Remove, Update, or Kindle-cache mutation bypasses current write proof.
- Existing Kindle objects are never overwritten or broadly deleted. Possible, stale, partial, and ambiguous evidence cannot authorize deletion.
- Update uses **prepare → upload → verify → durably record → exact old delete → absence verification**; low capacity never silently switches to delete-first.
- Provider results are reviewed overlays. No candidate auto-selects fields and no provider receives source bytes, paths, Kindle data, or arbitrary outbound URLs.
- Raw Kindle inventory and reading evidence remain browser-local. Experimental partial/KFX/reading behavior remains disabled until physical acceptance.
- Queue, shelf, issue, candidate, activity, sidecar, and decision records have explicit ceilings and reject oversized destructive/transfer work rather than silently truncate it.
- The default UI keeps secondary surfaces in drawers/sheets and low-level probes under Advanced.

## Final candidate record

- Feature candidate Git revision: `1ae91a1188631793c099230d581fcfb8770247ed`
- Final `npm run check`: **passed** in the pinned Node.js 24.20.0 Docker build on 2026-09-04 — 93 test files and 948 tests passed; client/server type checks and the production Vite build passed
- Canonical Docker build/smoke: **passed** as native `linux/arm64` image `sha256:1749294bd084341518f1c6727a752445a84a9d51ba9c6f75c605cb79a1a427d0`; a fresh empty `/data` and `/cache` tmpfs booted as UID/GID 1000 with a read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, and PID limit 128; `/api/healthz` returned `{"live":true}` and `/api/readyz` returned database/cache ready
- Live Open Library/Google Books acceptance: requires deployment egress and, for Google Books, a user-supplied key
- Existing household `/data` upgrade, restart, cold backup/restore, and derived rebuild rehearsal: external acceptance pending
- Native `linux/arm64` image and in-image CycloneDX SBOM generation: passed; cross-runtime `linux/amd64` execution and registry provenance verification remain pending the publishing environment
- Household read-only mounts and private HTTPS/WebUSB origin: external acceptance pending
- Maximum-supported-EPUB browser memory measurement on the intended client: external acceptance pending
- Physical `0x1949 / 0x9981` consolidated journey: external acceptance pending
